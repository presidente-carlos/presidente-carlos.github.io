		  We provide experimental evidence that monitoring of the police activity through body-worn cameras reduces use-of-force, handcuffs and arrests, and enhances criminal reporting by the police. Stronger treatment effects occur on events ex-ante classified as low risk. Monitoring effects are moderated by officer rank, which is consistent with a career concern motive by junior officers. Our results stand in sharp contrast with previous literature which, due to often used coarser designs, showed muted or null body-worn camera effects on use of force. We show that these designs are likely to suffer from attenuation biases. Overall, our results show that body-worn cameras robustly de-escalate citizen-police interactions.

            <p class="text add-top-margin">	    
	   In response to the increased cost of living, in particular energy/fuel costs, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the German government passed several measures in the first half of 2022 to alleviate the pressure on households. One such measure was the temporary introduction of a cheap, country-wide public transport ticket. In June, July, and August, one could take almost every train, bus, or tram throughout Germany for as little as 9 Euros a month. This paper first establisheds that the decrease in public transport fares indeed led to higher public transit ridership, and lower car traffic. It then proceeds to estimate whether the short-term price shock has had knock-on effects. In other words, did some motorists get a taste for using public transport when it was cheap, and decide to continue using it even when fares returned to their regular levels? To achieve this, I collect air pollution levels, peak-hour traffic times, and public transit ridership for over 30 German cities.

            <p class="text">
		The role of active industrial policy in transforming economic growth trajectories has attracted advocates from the both sides of the literature. Some emphasize the importance of industrial policies in the East Asian growth miracle, while others argue for the occurrence of the growth miracle despite industrial policies. I plan to take a more panoramic view of this issue by comparing the effects of industrial policies across East Asian countries using staggered difference-in-differences and counterfactual methods.

	    <p class="text">
	    <b> Broad Topic:</b> Applied Microeconomic Theory. <b> Specific Topic:</b> Information Design, Coordination Games, Economics of Culture.
            </p>

	    <b> Abstract</b>
            </p>	
            <p class="text">
During times of crisis when economic uncertainty is rampant, sound policymaking is paramount for a benevolent government that wishes to maximise social welfare; communication, in particular, becomes a powerful tool through which a government could guide society by affecting individuals’ beliefs. As people from different cultural backgrounds differ in what they find salient and how they respond to contextual cues, communication must be carefully tailored to a society’s cultural strength and diversity in order to achieve the desired outcome. This is not well-understood in the theoretical literature. Using an information design approach, I investigate how a benevolent government with commitment power optimally communicates with a society in which there is a continuum of players, potentially belonging to different groups. Players are randomly pairwise-matched and play a coordination game with multiple equilibria; crucially, their strategic behaviour is driven by societal culture and diversity via a process of introspection à la Kets and Sandroni (2021), which endogenises equilibrium selection. In the baseline model without diversity, I find that the government’s concavified payoff function under optimal communication is piece-wise and non-monotone in cultural strength; this non-linearity arises from conflicting coordination and persuasion effects. This model has possible applications to explaining cross-country differences in government communication during the Covid-19 pandemic and populism, and can generate empirically testable predictions.

            <p class="text">
One of the key predictions of Samuelson's discounted utility framework (DU) is that agents are time-consistent; however, empirical evidence usually detects such behavior in real life. I propose a theoretical framework that allows for time-inconsistency by introducing a minimal deviation from the DU assumption by relying on stationary instantaneous utility.

	    <p class="text">
	    <b> Broad Topic:</b> Public Economics. <b> Specific Topic:</b> International Corporate Taxation.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
	    <b> Abstract</b>
            </p>	
            <p class="text">
		Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) legislation is a set of rules implemented by many countries in an effort to counteract tax avoidance by multinational firms. These rules stipulate that selected parts of the income of a foreign subsidiary based in a low-tax country be included in the corporate tax base of its parent company. This income of the foreign subsidiary is thus subject to the higher corporate tax rate which the multinational firm faces in its home country. Exploiting a particular feature of the German tax system, this paper provides evidence on how the effects of CFC rules on multinational firms' financial decisions depend on home country corporate tax rates. German municipalities have autonomy over their local business tax rates which yields ample variation in corporate tax rates within Germany. Using information on the location of parent companies in Germany, I combine administrative panel data on foreign investment stocks of German multinationals with municipality-level corporate tax rates in Germany. This allows me to observe the tax rate on the income of a foreign subsidiary targeted by the German CFC rules.
