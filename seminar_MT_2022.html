		  This paper develops a tractable general equilibrium model to study the monetary policy and financial stability implications of the introduction of a retail central bank digital currency (retail CBDC). I construct a model that contains a heterogenous banking sector exhibiting market power, endogenous default, incomplete markets, and credit and deposit markets. My model replicates multiple channels through which monetary policy operate: the deposits channel, the bank lending and the risk-taking channel. I show that the transmission of monetary policy is dampened and household welfare loss arises. The introduction of a a retail CBDC is shown to improve the transmission of monetary policy. Furthermore, a retail CBDC is shown to increase competition in the monopolistic banking sector, thereby leading to a crowding in of savings via bank deposits, expanding bank intermediation, and thereby increasing output. However, a tradeoff naturally arises in the form of an increase in financial instability.

	   An increasing number of economists publish in teams. This paper attempts to examine what makes two economists collaborate and how much productivity gain comes with collaborations. I find that as the difference in the average publication quality, as measured by the journal quality index, gets smaller, two economists are more likely to collaborate. Moreover, similarity in log citation counts and being at the same institution both increase the chance of collaboration. There is also evidence of horizontal sorting (two authors of similar productivity) as well as vertical sorting (two authors of fairly different productivity). On average, a two-person team benefits from a 9% collaboration gain whereas a three-person team benefits from a 20% gain.

			When the policymaker is unable to distinguish across agentsâ€™ ability, classic adverse selection mechanisms may emerge leading to market unraveling. Here, I consider the problem of repeatedly choosing policy parameters, like public sector wages, in an adverse selection context, where the policymaker does not know the DGP of agents' types. The policimaker has the mandate to maximize social welfare subject to monopolistic and competitive equilibria considerations. However, unlike traditional bandit problems, (i) feedback is asymmetric across agents' decisions, and (ii) the policymaker may not observe utility at the end of the period.  This paper builds on previous literature on sequential public policy design, generalizing feedback as a function of agent's decisions. Moreover, for the first time, I introduce perfect competition considerations into the repeated game, maximizing consumer surplus. Non-zero measure of full-information feedback brings hope for sublinear regret, even for unknown sample size. Finally, the sequential characterization of the problem is very amenable to contextual characterization, (partially) escaping adverse selection when informative covariates are available.

            <p class="text">
Heterogeneity in preferences is important in many domains. However, many existing approaches to studying this phenomenon empirically come with trade-offs for the researcher. For example, parametric approaches often cannot be falsified or distinguish between the predictions of other models. Additionally, while revealed preference methods may identify the existence of a set of types, further economic analysis can be difficult to perform due to the non-parametric nature of these approaches. To complement such methods, this paper introduces a semi-parametric approach to studying preference heterogeneity that is grounded in economic theory, generates falsifiable empirical predictions, and yields economic content beyond a yes/no identification of diverse preferences. I present several empirical applications to demonstrate the advantages of this approach.

            <p class="text">	    
In the 1980s, provincial governments across Canada saw auto insurance premiums balloon and insurance company profits soar. In response, several provinces closed the private auto insurance market, opting to set up a public provincial monopoly that ran with a not-for-profit mandate. Other provinces, like Ontario, instead opted for a model of government oversight and regulation, where private companies were required to apply to a provincial regulator to raise or lower their premiums. We analyse approved applications for premium rate changes in Ontario from 1999 to 2022 to understand the implication of this oversight, and if profits in the Ontario auto insurance industry were indeed controlled.

            <p class="text">
We aim to overcome the selection issues when patients, in the United States, choose where to receive care to uncover the relationship between price and quality of care. We also briefly present a similar approach for estimating the relationship between for-profit hospital status and hospital admission decisions. For both of those, we use an instrumental variable approach which exploits that ambulance companies are quasi-randomly assigned to transport patients and have strong preferences for certain hospitals. We show a strong relationship between higher prices and lower mortality, which has important implications for healthcare price regulation. Being admitted to a hospital with two standard deviations higher prices raises spending by 52% and lowers mortality by 1 percentage point (35%). However, the relationship between higher prices and lower mortality is only present at hospitals in less concentrated markets. Receiving care from an expensive hospital in a concentrated market increases spending but has no detectable effect on mortality.
