		  This paper develops a tractable general equilibrium model to study the monetary policy and financial stability implications of the introduction of a retail central bank digital currency (retail CBDC). I construct a model that contains a heterogenous banking sector exhibiting market power, endogenous default, incomplete markets, and credit and deposit markets. My model replicates multiple channels through which monetary policy operate: the deposits channel, the bank lending and the risk-taking channel. I show that the transmission of monetary policy is dampened and household welfare loss arises. The introduction of a a retail CBDC is shown to improve the transmission of monetary policy. Furthermore, a retail CBDC is shown to increase competition in the monopolistic banking sector, thereby leading to a crowding in of savings via bank deposits, expanding bank intermediation, and thereby increasing output. However, a tradeoff naturally arises in the form of an increase in financial instability.

	   An increasing number of economists publish in teams. This paper attempts to examine what makes two economists collaborate and how much productivity gain comes with collaborations. I find that as the difference in the average publication quality, as measured by the journal quality index, gets smaller, two economists are more likely to collaborate. Moreover, similarity in log citation counts and being at the same institution both increase the chance of collaboration. There is also evidence of horizontal sorting (two authors of similar productivity) as well as vertical sorting (two authors of fairly different productivity). On average, a two-person team benefits from a 9% collaboration gain whereas a three-person team benefits from a 20% gain.

			When the policymaker is unable to distinguish across agentsâ€™ ability, classic adverse selection mechanisms may emerge leading to market unraveling. Here, I consider the problem of repeatedly choosing policy parameters, like public sector wages, in an adverse selection context, where the policymaker does not know the DGP of agents' types. The policimaker has the mandate to maximize social welfare subject to monopolistic and competitive equilibria considerations. However, unlike traditional bandit problems, (i) feedback is asymmetric across agents' decisions, and (ii) the policymaker may not observe utility at the end of the period.  This paper builds on previous literature on sequential public policy design, generalizing feedback as a function of agent's decisions. Moreover, for the first time, I introduce perfect competition considerations into the repeated game, maximizing consumer surplus. Non-zero measure of full-information feedback brings hope for sublinear regret, even for unknown sample size. Finally, the sequential characterization of the problem is very amenable to contextual characterization, (partially) escaping adverse selection when informative covariates are available.

            <p class="text">
Heterogeneity in preferences is important in many domains. However, many existing approaches to studying this phenomenon empirically come with trade-offs for the researcher. For example, parametric approaches often cannot be falsified or distinguish between the predictions of other models. Additionally, while revealed preference methods may identify the existence of a set of types, further economic analysis can be difficult to perform due to the non-parametric nature of these approaches. To complement such methods, this paper introduces a semi-parametric approach to studying preference heterogeneity that is grounded in economic theory, generates falsifiable empirical predictions, and yields economic content beyond a yes/no identification of diverse preferences. I present several empirical applications to demonstrate the advantages of this approach.

            <p class="text">	    
In the 1980s, provincial governments across Canada saw auto insurance premiums baloon and profits soare. To reel in the industry, many provinces shut the whole things down, opting to set up a public provincial monopoly that ran with a non-profit mandate. Some provinces like Onatrio instead opted for an incredible amount of oversight and regulation, where private companies are requried to apply to the provincial regulator to raise or lower their premiums. We analysis approved applications for premium rates changes from 1999 to 2022 to understand the implication of the oversight and if profits in the industry were indeed controlled.

	    <p class="text">
	    <b> Broad Topic:</b> Labor Economics, Gender Economics. <b> Specific Topic:</b> Public Policy Evaluation.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
	    <b> Abstract</b>
            </p>	
            <p class="text">
	    This paper aims to assess the impact of self-evaluation policies in addressing gender wage discrimination. The measures aim to provide employers with a simple way to evaluate their compensation practices with respect to potential gender bias. I employ a difference-in-difference strategy using employee-level data from Luxembourg, Germany, and Belgium before and after the implementation of the policy. Self-evaluation tools are particularly relevant as employees may not have enough bargaining power to benefit from other equal pay measures such as pay transparency. Here, the intervention relies on the employer and thus presents a viable alternative. In all three countries studied, governments praise compliers but do not impose fines on firms that find evidence of discrimination, providing advice and financial support instead. My preliminary results show a reduction in the gender wage gap as a result of the policy. However, I document concerns in the related literature regarding gender wage gap measures that jeopardize the validity of my analysis. I provide an alternative that uses measures based on the value of work instead of the characteristics of the employee. I consider job demands along four dimensions: knowledge, responsibilities, psycho-social demands, and physical demands, which I propose to evaluate for each ISCO-08 occupation code. I suggest the use of ISCO-08 skill qualificafition levels and data from occupational medicine, which provides insights into the intellectual, emotional, and physical demands of specific occupations.
